      <p>
        Hello, my name is Damian Piorun and I am a frontend developer. Over the
        past two years, I have dedicated most of my waking hours to programming
        user interfaces (UI).
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my specialties is taking an idea from scratch and turning it into
        a fully-functional platform. I strive to create sites with a unique,
        outstanding, and contemporary look-and-feel. With extensive knowledge of
        web mechanics, I can optimize complex integrations to require minimal
        maintenance while running smoothly on their own.
      </p>
